/**
 * The entry point compiled into this package's `claude-agent-acp` binary.
 *
 * `claude-agent-acp` is a Node program that drives a second, much larger program: the native
 * Claude Code CLI, which the Claude Agent SDK normally resolves out of its own `node_modules` as
 * a platform-specific optional dependency. That resolution cannot work inside a compiled
 * single-file binary — there is no `node_modules` to resolve against — so this module answers the
 * question the SDK would have answered, before handing control to the adapter unchanged.
 *
 * It runs as the adapter's own process, which means two constraints from the plugin apply here
 * too: stdout is the ACP channel and nothing but ACP frames may ever be written to it, and every
 * diagnostic goes to stderr.

 * exact CLI build, so the pair in this package is the pair upstream tested. A local install is a
 * fallback for the cases where the bundled one cannot run at all, and it is deliberately not
 * preferred over the bundled one even when it is newer — the bridge between adapter and CLI is an
 * internal interface, and an unpaired combination fails in ways that only reproduce on the
