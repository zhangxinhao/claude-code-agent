/**
 * Builds one `.orax` per target, each carrying the ACP adapter and the Claude Code CLI it drives.
 *
 * Nothing here decides a version: `upstream.lock.json` records the whole chain and this script
 * reproduces it, verifying every download against the digest recorded there. What to build for
 * comes from `bundle.config.ts`, and where the binaries land inside a package comes from
 * `src/services/bundled-binary.ts`, which is also what the running plugin reads — a mismatch
 * between staging and spawning would only ever surface as an install that cannot start.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   deno task package                                  # every target, tag from orax.toml
 *   deno task package --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc  # just one, for a local install
 *   deno task package --tag v0.73.0 --repo owner/name  # what CI runs, and what writes a manifest
 *
 * Produces `dist/packages/<identifier>-<tag>-<triple>.orax`, plus `dist/manifest.toml` — the
 * release form of the manifest the marketplace index needs — when a repository is named.
