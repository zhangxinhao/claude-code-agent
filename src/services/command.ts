 * real installer produces has to be named here or the adapter is reported missing on a machine
 * that has it. `claude-agent-acp` is an npm-published binary, so a `.cmd`/`.bat` shim is the

 * `Deno.Command` cannot promise — least of all through a Windows `.cmd`/`.bat` shim, where the
 * handle a plugin holds is the shim and the real adapter underneath it can outlive a kill of the
 * wrapper.
 *
 * No `packageCommand` is named because this package ships no adapter of its own — `claude-agent-acp`
 * is always the user's own npm install.
