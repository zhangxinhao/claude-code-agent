/**
 * Serves the `agent/acp` notification by piping one host frame into the adapter verbatim.
 *
 * The frame is never parsed. ACP carries its own ids, ordering, and cancellation, so anything this
 * plugin decided about a payload would only be a second, weaker copy of what the two ACP peers
 * already agreed on. It is also what lets Claude Code's ACP extensions — session modes, steering,
 * its `_meta` capabilities — reach Ora without this plugin knowing they exist. `effects` only reads
 * `method` and `id` off the envelope, to hold a new turn behind the Skill Effect barrier when one
 * is engaged; see {@link SkillEffectCoordinator}.
 *
 * A frame that arrives while the adapter is down is dropped with a warning rather than throwing:
 * notifications have no response channel, so the host would never see the error, and failing the
 * handler cannot recover the frame either.
